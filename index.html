        <p>Food contamination is a really serious public health problem that has been present all around the world and now is even more alarming, since this is causing severe resulting diseases that affect human beings every year. Most of the foods contain microorganisms, these microorganisms that grow in foods can generate changes in appearance, flavor, odor, and other features of the foods. This and more aspects are changing food quality making our source of life a big danger for us.</p>

        <h1>What is microplastics?</h1>
        <p>Most of the plastics produced become worn and start breaking into small fragments called microplastics. Microplastics are considered to be small plastic particles less than about 5mm and it is known that this is affecting our food since it is being contaminated and exposed by this.</p>

        <h1>How does it become part of our meals?</h1>
        <p>Microplastics are eaten by marine life or any other living thing, who mistake these for food. Once they eat them, there is a high probability that it becomes part of the human food.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There have been studies which showed that this isn’t the only reason that microplastic is being introduced into our food chain, there is a possible presence in sea salt, honey, beer, bottled water, and organic fertilizers used in our daily activities.</p>

        <h1>Dangers in microplastics</h1>
        <p>Even though we aren’t able to see it ,microplastics are causing serious problems to all of us since they are small pieces of stabilizers, lubricants, fillers, plasticizers, and other manufacturers which have a big durability, they are toxic to the human body and really harmful like: Disrupting hormones, increment of chronic diseases, impairing immune health, etc.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>How much are we usually exposed to?</h1>
        <p>Research suggests that an average person in the United States may consume over 50,000 particles of microplastics from food alone per year. This figure increases to an estimated 90,000 in those who regularly consume plastic-based bottled water, and to 120,000 when considering the inhalation of microplastics from non-food sources.”(PubMed central, 2019)</p>
